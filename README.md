## Database Setup

Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database created. Create a `.env` file in the project folder with the following configurations:

```dotenv
DATABASE_HOSTNAME=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
DATABASE_USERNAME=your_database_username
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
```

Replace the placeholders (`your_...`) with your actual database and secret key details. The secret key can be obtained from the FastAPI documentation.

**Note**: The provided `SECRET_KEY` in this example is a placeholder. You should generate a proper secret key for security purposes.
